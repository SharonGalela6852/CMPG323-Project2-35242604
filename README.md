# About the project

EcoPower Logistics sells solar energy parts like panels and batteries. They also manage the process of moving goods, from storage to delivery, using technology and coordination. They want to create a system that connects to a database using RESTful APIs.

These APIs will help them manage logistics data, like orders and inventory. They'll have methods to create, read, update, and delete data. This will make their operations smoother and allow customers to track their orders in real time.
