# About the project

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive logistics system known as EcoPower Logistics. The system specializes in the distribution of vital components needed for the installation, operation, and optimization of solar energy systems. These components, including solar panels, inverters, batteries, and monitoring systems, harness solar energy to generate usable electricity.

EcoPower Logistics excels in the precise coordination required for the movement of goods, encompassing warehousing and transportation. The system ensures the seamless acquisition, storage, and global transportation of resources and goods. It places a strong emphasis on maintaining the integrity of the delivered solar products, employing meticulous packaging, vehicle inspections, and real-time tracking.

Technology integration plays a pivotal role in the EcoPower Logistics project. The system recognizes the potential advantages offered by the integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in the logistics sector. By leveraging Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture, EcoPower Logistics aims to establish a set of RESTful APIs.

The primary objective of these APIs is to manage logistics data effectively. This includes orders, shipments, inventory, and other relevant information. The API will feature CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods accessible through various endpoints. This approach streamlines the interaction with the database and ensures efficient order processing and real-time status updates.

The overarching goal of the EcoPower Logistics project is to optimize logistics operations in the solar energy sector. By leveraging technology, efficient packaging, and API integration, the system aims to enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and facilitate the secure and timely delivery of solar products to customers.

## Creation of the API
Certainly, here's a more detailed guide on creating an API that interacts with an Azure SQL Database, along with simplified screenshots where applicable:

1. **Azure Account Setup:**
   - Sign in to your Azure portal or create a new account if you don't have one.
   - ![Azure Portal](https://example.com/azure_portal.png)

2. **Create an Azure SQL Database:**
   - Click on "Create a resource" on the Azure portal dashboard.
   - Search for "SQL Database" and select it.
   - Follow the wizard to configure your database, including server settings, database name, pricing tier, and security settings.
   - ![Create SQL Database](https://example.com/create_sql_db.png)

3. **Get Database Connection Details:**
   - Once your database is created, navigate to its overview page.
   - Note down the server name, database name, and authentication details (username and password).
   - ![Database Overview](https://example.com/db_overview.png)

4. **Choose a Programming Language and Framework:**
   - Decide on the programming language and framework you'll use. For example, let's use Node.js with Express.

5. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
   - Create a new directory for your project and run `npm init` to set up your project.

6. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   - Install necessary packages using `npm install express mssql` to connect to Azure SQL.

7. **Connect to the Azure SQL Database:**
   - Use the connection details to configure a connection to your Azure SQL Database.
   - ![Database Connection](https://example.com/db_connection.png)

8. **Define API Endpoints:**
   - Decide on the API endpoints you want to create, such as `/orders`, `/shipments`, etc.
   - Use Express to set up routes that map to your endpoint functions.

9. **Implement CRUD Operations:**
   - Write code in your endpoint functions to perform CRUD operations using SQL queries.
   - ![CRUD Operations](https://example.com/crud_operations.png)

10. **Handle Data Validation and Serialization:**
    - Use validation libraries or custom code to validate incoming data.
    - Serialize your database responses into JSON format for API responses.

11. **Test Your API:**
    - Use Postman to test your API endpoints. Send sample requests and observe responses.
    - ![Postman Test](https://example.com/postman_test.png)

12. **Implement Security Measures:**
    - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using Azure Active Directory.
    - Configure firewall rules on your Azure SQL Database to restrict access.
    - ![Firewall Rules](https://example.com/firewall_rules.png)

13. **Document Your API:**
    - Create clear documentation explaining each endpoint's purpose, required parameters, and response formats.
    - ![API Documentation](https://example.com/api_documentation.png)

14. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your API to a service like Azure App Service.
    - ![Deploy to Azure](https://example.com/deploy_to_azure.png)

15. **Monitor and Maintain:**
    - Utilize Azure's monitoring and logging tools to track your API's performance and usage.
